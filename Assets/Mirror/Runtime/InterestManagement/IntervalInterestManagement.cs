        // note:
        //   we DO NOT do any custom rebuilding after someone joined/spawned or
        //   disconnected/unspawned.
        //   this would require INSANE complexity.
        //   for example, OnTransportDisconnect would have to:
        //     1. remove the connection so the connectionId is invalid
        //     2. then call BroadcastAfterUnspawn(oldEntity) which broadcasts
        //        destroyed messages BEFORE rebuilding so we know the old
        //        observers that need to get the destroyed message
        //     3. RebuildAfterUnspawn to remove it
        //     4. then remove the Entity from connection's owned objects, which
        //        IS NOT POSSIBLE anymore because the connection was already
        //        removed. which means that the next rebuild would still see it
        //        etc.
        //        (it's just insanity)
        //   additionally, we would also need extra flags in Spawn to NOT
        //   rebuild when spawning 10k scene objects in start, etc.s
        //
        // first principles:
        //   it wouldn't even make sense to have special cases because players
        //   might walk in and out of range from each other all the time anyway.
        //   we already need to handle that case. (dis)connect is no different.
